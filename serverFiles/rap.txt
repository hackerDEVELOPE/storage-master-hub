Travelling

Mr. and Mrs. Charly were on a tour to Europe. They were travelling on a guided tour to five countries. They were going to travel through The Netherland, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and France for two weeks.
The guide for the tour was a Swiss. On the day of the travel the guide told them to check their passports, their traveler cheques, and their foreign cash. He told them to keep them safely.
They traveled in a comfortable coach with a toilet, music, and video. The guide stopped the coach at many famous places. He explained the cultural importance of the places. They stayed in big hotels for the night and ate in the restaurants.
